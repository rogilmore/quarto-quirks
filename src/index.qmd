# About

This Quarto book documents some of the ways I like to use Quarto for [e-books](books.qmd), talk [slides](slides.qmd), [websites](sites.qmd), and [plots](plots.qmd).

Search engines are extremely useful tools for answering similar questions.
Here, I try to capture specific implementations that I have found useful in my own work.

In fairness to Quarto, this site has more to do with *my* quirks than Quarto's.
But I liked the alliteration.

::: {.callout-note}
I now use Quarto regularly.
But there are many, many things I do not yet know about how to use it most
effectively.
And I find that it's easy to forget things I've figured out some months prior.
