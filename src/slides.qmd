# Slides

This page describes some practices I use when generating RevealJS slide decks.

## GitHub repo

For many years, I have made separate repositories for each talk.
Course lectures are a special case.
I'll talk about them later.

So, my talk to the Central Pennsylvania Observers (CPO) astronomy club sits
under a repo titled 'cpo-talk-radio-astronomy' that resides under my
'rogilmore' GitHub account.
I've set-up that account to host my blog, and so this means that this talk
lives at `rick-gilmore.com/cpo-talk-radio-astronomy`.
This talk should probably have had a date.

The single repo per talk scheme works well in this case, and it involves
a simpler file directory organization on my local machine.
I do not create separate `src/` and `docs/` directories, nor is a `_quarto.yml`
file needed.
I simply create `index.qmd`, and an `include/` directory, then render the output
to the project root.
