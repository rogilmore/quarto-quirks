This chapter summarizes some things I have learned in creating web books.

### Adding buttons and links to the repo

I find it useful to add automatically generated links to the site source code.
So, for this project, the following YAML header adds those components site-wide.

```
book:
  title: "Quarto Quirks"
  author: "Rick Gilmore"
  chapters:
    - index.qmd
    - meta.qmd
    - books.qmd
    - slides.qmd
    - sites.qmd
  repo-url: https://github.com/rogilmore/quarto-quirks
  repo-actions: [edit, issue]
  repo-subdir: src
```

The `repo-url:` is self-explanatory.
If you're using a separate `src/` directory, then the `repo-subdir:` parameter
specifies that.
If the source code is in the project root directory, you need not specify
a value for this parameter.
It defaults to the project root.

To be clear, no one has yet filed an issue or made a pull request.
But they could, and I like the transparency this permits.
