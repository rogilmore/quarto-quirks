This page documents some practices that make my workflow more efficient.

## Github

Almost every project starts with a new GitHub repository.

I try to create a repo name that would make a reasonably informative web site name.
That way I can use the GitHub Pages feature to host the site.

## RStudio projects

Once I have created a repo on GitHub and copied it to my clipboard, I open 
RStudio and create a new project.

## Dependency management

I am now using `{renv}` to manage package dependencies.
So, once I have created the project, I run `renv::init()` to initialize the
project for `renv()`.

### Modify `.gitignore`

This is a good time to make our first git commit.
I right-click on the `*.Rproj` project file since that is specific to me.

## Directory structure

I prefer that my project's root directory have two subdirectories, `src/`, and `docs/`.
The `src/` directory is where the source code lives.
The `docs/` directory is where the rendered output goes.

GitHub Pages permits the user to select the `docs/` directory for building a site.
So, this structure makes that process very clean.
