I right-click on the *.Rproj project and .Rprofile files since those are specific to me.

The key is to create a separate directory for my lecture notes, and then specify in the YAML header information for the Quarto documents in that folder that they are RevealJS slides.\nSo, in the case of PSYCH 490, I have a src/notes directory, and one of the slide files there has the following YAML header data:\ntitle: \"Course intro\"\nsubtitle: \"2024-08-26 Mon\"\nauthor: \"Rick Gilmore\"\nformat: \n  revealjs:\n    footer: \"[PSYCH 490.012 • Fall 2024](../index.html)\"\n    slide-number: true\nbibliography: [../include/bib/packages.bib, ../include/bib/psu-repro.bib]\ncsl: ../include/bib/apa.csl\ncss: ../include/css/styles.css\nThe title: and subtitle: fields are custom to each set of slides. The others are consistent across slides. Note that the footer: parameter creates a link back to the home page of the site. This makes the slides part of the site. Also note that the bibliography:, csl:, and css: parameters specify the path from the notes/ directory to the include/ directory and its components. This is critical to take advantage of Quarto’s built-in citation generation features.\nI go back and forth about whether to create a notes/ menu item with links to specific lecture notes or simply embed them in the schedule.qmd file. The menu can get very crowded with too many choices. So, this term I’m not creating a separate notes/slides menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOn my to-do list this term is to figure out how to create a folder-specific YAML file with some of the common parameters.",
